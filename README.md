An application which provides information about the current weather and forecast (daily as well as hourly forecast) in your city. It also provides weather info by accessing your location.

This websites is created using React.js and API's from Rapid API to fetch weather details by city name and to perform reverse geocoding on providing current location.

The web application has used Tailwind CSS for styling the site, making it responsive and supports smartphones as well as tablets.

Features implemented in this website:

Fetched weather data from Rapid API's WeatherAPI.com.
Used Reverse Geocoding API to convert latitude and longitude to find the name of the city of a user.
Used Luxon library to convert localtime epoch (number format of time) into desired data and time format.
Used React Toastify library to send alerts and notification on fetching weather data and upon performing other operations.
Used Tailwind CSS to create responsive site.
Used React routing to create single-page application and to avoid unnecessary page reloads.

Things that I learned:

React from basics to advance.
Tailwind from basics to advance.
Learnt fetching, destructuring and displaying the data on the site.
